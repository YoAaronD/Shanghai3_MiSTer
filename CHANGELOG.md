# Changelog

Versions follow two conventions:

- **Git tags** (`v0.1.0` …) mark milestones in this repo:
  - 0.x until the core is fully working on hardware
  - 1.0.0 for the first public release
- **Date stamps** are the MiSTer convention:
  - Each Quartus build stamps its date into the core automatically (`sys/build_id.tcl`); the OSD shows it as `vYYMMDD`.
  - Released core files are named `Shanghai3_YYYYMMDD.rbf` in `releases/`. The MRA's `<rbf>Shanghai3</rbf>` picks up the newest one.

Each entry below gives both: version, then date stamp.

## v0.1.0 — 20261021

First version expected to compile in Quartus. Not yet tested on a MiSTer.

**Changed**
- Display frame buffer moved from block RAM to the MiSTer's DDR3 (address 0x30000000).
  - The first Quartus build (20261020) failed: the design needed more than the 553 M10K blocks of block RAM.
  - This frees about 130 blocks; the core now uses about 270.
  - The draw buffer stays in block RAM. Scan-out reads each line from DDR3 one line ahead. The copy goes through a 128-word FIFO, so DDR3 stalls don't slow the blitter.
  - Simulation with a DDR3 model (random stalls): 1,900 frames and all 9.44 M CPU writes identical to the previous design.

**Added**
- Real MAME as a reference: `scripts/build_mame.sh` (headless single-driver MAME), `tools/mame/frame_log.lua` (every frame plus blitter starts) and `scripts/mame_latency.py` (frame-timing comparison).
- `CLAUDE.md`: steering file for future Claude sessions.
- `docs/SAME_BOARD_GAMES.md`: plan for Hebereke no Popoon and Blocken.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: this file.

**Known issues**
- Each blitter result appears **one frame later than in MAME** (confirmed against real MAME, 700 of 700 matched frames). To be fixed after hardware bring-up; see `docs/HANDOFF.md` §10.
- 96 of 1,001 compared frames differ from MAME during title-screen transitions, some only by a few color levels. Not investigated yet.
- Never run on real hardware: SDRAM clock phase, DDR3 access, sync positions, centering and audio levels are untested.

## Before v0.1.0 (unversioned)

- **20261020** — OKI M6295 phrase table kept in block RAM. jt6295 dropped sound commands when table lookups went through SDRAM.
- **20261020** — Initial import: 68000 (fx68k), GA9201 blitter (two-phase snapshot design), frame buffers, YM2149, OKI M6295, SDRAM ROM loading with CPU cache, CRT Adjust, MiSTer wrapper, MRA. Verified in simulation only.
